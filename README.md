WHAT IS GEMATRIA?

The Torah or Bible was encoded with a system of code from the beginning which predates
any assyro-babylonian-greek system. It is clearly known to God, and was created by God. 

In the Book of Revelation we see and read, that "anyone who has understanding will count the number of the beast", these words coming from Jesus, or Jesus's angel aka the angel of the Lord shows that this system is of some importance but most christians today and Bible scholars discredit it as a form of sorcery or witch craft.

You can read the verse which is located at Revelation 

Unfortunately due to secret societies adopting these systems of numerology and using it part of their
rituals has perverted and diluded this practice, ultimately stripping people of a level of understanding. Or, trying to atleast. 

notes: Gematria is an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of code and numerology later adopted into Jewish culture that assigns numerical value to a word or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself as it may apply to Nature, a person's age, the calendar year, or the like.
