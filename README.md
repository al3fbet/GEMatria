**WHAT IS GEMATRIA?**

The Torah or Bible was encoded with a system of code embedded in the Hebrew language from the beginning which predates any Assyrian-Babylonian-Greek system. It is clearly known to God and was created by God since God is the Creator of all.

In the Book of Revelation, we see and read, that "anyone who has understanding will count the number of the beast", these words coming from Jesus, or Jesus's angel aka the angel of the Lord shows that this system is of some importance but many Christians today and Bible scholars discredit it as a form of sorcery or witchcraft.

You can read the verse which is located at:

```Revelation 13:18 - "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."```

Many people believe today that this represents a computer or chip or is associated to them in some manner, however, the book of Revelation teaches otherwise.

**Unfortunately**

Due to secret societies adopting these systems of numerology and using it as part of their rituals and practices, it has perverted and diluted this practice. 

Ultimately trying to strip people of a level of understanding. 

I have dedicated my time and energy to this study all while going through the process of sanctification and I am grateful to God each day for the time He gives me to study and for every soul I am able to win for His kingdom from my sharing of His word, His truth, and His testimony.

**Notes that were given by ChatGPT:**     
< ---- <strong>This is misinformation</strong>

Gematria is an Assyrian-Babylonian-Greek system of code and numerology later adopted into Jewish culture that assigns numerical value to a word or phrase in the belief that words or phrases with identical numerical values bear some relation to each other or bear some relation to the number itself as it may apply to Nature, a person's age, the calendar year, or the like. ---->
